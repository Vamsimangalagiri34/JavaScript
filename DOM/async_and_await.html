    <!-- 
        async and await are used to handle promise

        async it returns a promise 

        if a async function returns a other promise than it will check it was promise or not 
        if its a promise than retuns the promise it doesnt wrappe a promise into a promise 
        const p=new Promise((r,j)=>{
            r('vam');
        })
        async function getinfo(){
            return p;//it does not wrape the promise it just return the orignal promise
        }

        await is used in async function we write infront of a promisej

      async  function getData(){
            return "vamsi";//wrapping data into a promise and return
        }
        console.log(typeof getData)
        const c=getData();
        console.log(typeof c);//object
        console.log(c)


        const p=new Promise((r,j)=>{
            r('from r');
        })
        async function pan(){
            //JS engine was waiting for promise resolve resolve means promise get statisified
             const val= await p;//it stops the hole code its execution after remaing get excuted
             console.log(val);
        }

<!-- 
    Async Function:

When you declare a function with the async keyword, it becomes an asynchronous function.
An async function always returns a promise, which allows you to use the await keyword inside it.
 -->

 <!-- When you use await with a promise, 
    it essentially pauses the execution of the async function until the promise is resolved. The resolved value of the promise is then returned,  -->
