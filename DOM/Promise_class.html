    //In JavaScript, common mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations include:
<!-- 
Callbacks: Functions that are passed as arguments and executed when an asynchronous operation completes. Callbacks, however, can lead to callback hell or nesting when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous code and avoid callback hell.

Async/Await: A syntax built on top of promises, providing a more synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code. It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and write. -->
