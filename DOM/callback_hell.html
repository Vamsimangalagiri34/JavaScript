        /*
         Pyramid of Doom
        nested callbacks, especially when they become deeply nested or complex, are often referred to as "callback hell." This term is used to describe a situation
         where multiple asynchronous operations are nested within one another, making the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.
         old pattern to handle asynchronous functions.
         use promises + async /await to avoid callback hell.
         A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of a specific task.
        */
        /*
One of the best examples of using asynchronous operations is in web applications that involve fetching data from an API and updating the user interface dynamically without blocking the main thread.
