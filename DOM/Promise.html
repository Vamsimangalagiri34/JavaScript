    <!-- 
        Promises are used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured and manageable way. Asynchronous operations are tasks that may take some time to complete, 
        such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or making a network request. Promises provide a cleaner and more readable syntax for dealing with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.
