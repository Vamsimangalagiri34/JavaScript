    In JavaScript, asynchronous operations are those that don't block the execution 
    of the rest of the code. Instead, they are scheduled to run after a certain time, after the completion of an I/O operation (like reading a file or making a network request), or in response to an event. -->

    <!--
        Definition: Synchronous code executes one operation at a time, blocking further execution until the current operation is complete.
Characteristics: Predictable execution order, easy to understand, but can be less efficient for tasks that take time.
        dont block the code means 
    by defaultly java follows Synchronous code execution it means one line after other get execcuted
    like

    <!-- 
        the setTimeout function is commonly used to simulate asynchronous behavior in JavaScript. While JavaScript is a single-threaded language, certain operations, such as network requests or animations, can be time-consuming.
         setTimeout allows you to schedule a function to be executed after a specified delay, allowing the rest of the code to continue its execution without waiting for the delayed function to complete.
     -->

     <!-- console.log("hey lambda");//it execute first 
        alert("you will achive one day");//after these we have to press ok to complete its execution
        console.log("see you later");//after executing alert completelt 3rd statement execute.
    
       When I say that an asynchronous function returns a promise implicitly, I mean that the function itself doesn't need to explicitly create or return a Promise object.
        The JavaScript runtime automatically wraps the return value of an asynchronous function in a promise

        Asynchronous operations are typically associated with callbacks, promises, or async/await. 
        It allows the program to pause and resume at that point once the asynchronous operation is done
        Definition: Asynchronous code allows non-blocking operations, enabling the program to proceed with other tasks while waiting for specific operations to complete.
Characteristics: Efficient for tasks that involve waiting, may involve callbacks, promises, or async/await.
