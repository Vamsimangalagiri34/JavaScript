<!-- here are 7 types of primitive data types  -->
<!-- 3 types of reference types 
objects
array
function
-->
<!-- in js data type is dynmaicaly changed so we can assign df data types to a same vaialbe -->

    <script>
        
        <!-- String -->
        <!-- String is collection of characters a string is ends or starts with ' or "" '-->
        <!-- Number it represent integer and floating points number -->
        let n=34;
        let n2=45.35;
        let n1=34;
        console.log(n1);
        console.log(n2)
        let n3=45.00;
        console.log(n3);
        <!-- it will return 45 it treated as a number to use less memeory if we want to get points we can convert it into sstring or using by .toFixed() -->
    console.log(typeof n2);
    <!-- Boolean -->
    
    let v=false;

    <!-- undefined when we declare a variable but not assign any value whrn fetch the variable than we get result as undefined or mising the value-->

<!-- undefined usually indicates an unintentional absence of a value, such as when a variable is declared but not assigned.
    null typically represents a deliberate absence of an object or value, indicating that no object is assigned or that a property intentionally has no value.
    It's worth noting that both undefined and null are falsy values in JavaScript, which means they evaluate to false in a boolean context. Additionally, comparing them with the equality operator (==) without type-checking (===) may result in true, as undefined == null evaluates to true. -->
    console.log("the type of null is object it was an known bug in js the both undefined and null boolean values are flase when we compare both it returns true");


    <!-- BigInt -->
    const regularNumber = 123;
    const bigIntNumber = 123n;
    
    In JavaScript, when you append an n or N to the end of a numeric literal, it signifies that the literal is a BigInt. The BigInt type was introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) to handle arbitrary-precision integers, allowing developers to work with integers beyond the safe integer limit imposed by regular JavaScript numbers.
    Arbitrary-precision integers, often referred to simply as "arbitrary-precision numbers" or "bignumbers,
