Async and Await in JavaScript
The async and await keywords are used to handle asynchronous code more effectively, making it easier to write and read compared to traditional methods like callbacks or .then() in Promises.

Async
The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function.
An async function always returns a Promise.
The resolved value of the async function becomes the value returned by the function.
Await
The await keyword is used inside an async function to pause execution until the promise resolves.
It can only be used in an async function.
It simplifies chaining of asynchronous operations and makes the code look synchronous.

real time examples
1. Fetching Data from APIs
Example: A weather app fetching current weather data from an external API.
Async operations ensure the UI remains responsive while waiting for the API response.
. Real-Time Chat Applications
Example: Chat apps like WhatsApp or Slack use async operations to send and receive messages without blocking the UI.
Async functions handle data streaming over WebSockets
3. File Uploads and Downloads
Example: Uploading images or files on platforms like Google Drive.
Async operations enable progress tracking without freezing the UI.

5. Background Tasks
Example: Email notifications sent in the background after a user action.
Async operations ensure that the user doesnâ€™t wait for the task to complete.
