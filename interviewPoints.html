    <!-- Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages that serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here are some key differences between Java and JavaScript:

Purpose:

Java: It is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for building platform-independent, large-scale applications. Java is often used for server-side development, mobile applications (Android), and enterprise-level software.
JavaScript: It is a lightweight, interpreted scripting language primarily used for web development. JavaScript is mainly employed for creating dynamic content on the client side within web browsers.
Execution Environment:

Java: Java applications are typically compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java platform-independent and allows "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability.
JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed directly by web browsers. Every modern web browser has a JavaScript engine to interpret and execute JavaScript code.
Static vs Dynamic Typing:

Java: It is a statically-typed language, meaning that variable types are declared at compile-time, and type checking is performed during compilation.
JavaScript: It is a dynamically-typed language, where variable types are determined at runtime. This provides flexibility but can lead to runtime errors if not handled properly.
Object-Oriented vs Prototype-Based:

Java: It is a class-based, object-oriented programming language, where objects are instances of classes, and inheritance is based on class hierarchies.
JavaScript: It is prototype-based, relying on prototypes for inheritance. Objects can serve as prototypes for other objects, allowing for dynamic and flexible object creation.
Usage:

Java: Commonly used for developing standalone applications, web applications (server-side using technologies like Java EE or Spring), Android mobile applications, and enterprise-level systems.
JavaScript: Primarily used for enhancing user interfaces on the client side of web applications. It is also used on the server side (Node.js) and for developing cross-platform mobile applications (React Native, Ionic).
Concurrency Model:

Java: Utilizes multithreading for concurrent programming. Java supports creating and managing multiple threads to execute tasks concurrently.
JavaScript: Follows a single-threaded event-driven model. Asynchronous operations are commonly achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
Syntax:

Java: Has a C-style syntax and follows a more rigid structure with explicit data types and strong static typing.
JavaScript: Has a syntax influenced by C, but it is more forgiving and flexible. It is loosely typed, and variables can change types during runtime. -->

Symbols are immutable and unique; their values cannot be changed once they are created.

    const c=getQueryVaiable('name');
    console.log(c);
