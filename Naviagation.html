        //In JavaScript, the term "navigator" refers to the Navigator object, which is part of the window object in browsers. 
        //The Navigator object provides information about the browser's name, version, platform, and capabilities. It allows JavaScript code to query information about the environment in which it is executing
        //The "navigation" in JavaScript often refers to managing the navigation of web pages within a browser window or tab. 
        //This typically involves actions like navigating to a new URL, going back or forward in the browser's history, or reloading the current page
        //JavaScript provides methods for performing these navigation actions. For example:

//window.location: Provides information about the current URL and allows you to navigate to a new URL.
//window.history: Allows you to manipulate the browser's history, enabling actions like going back or forward in the history stack.
//window.location.reload(): Reloads the current page.

//In summary, "navigation" is about moving between web pages or changing the state of the current page, while "navigator" refers to the JavaScript object that provides information about the browser environment. 
//They are related concepts but serve different purposes in web development.
